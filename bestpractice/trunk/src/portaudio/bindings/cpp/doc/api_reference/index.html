<h1>PortAudioCpp </h1><h3 class="version">2.0 </h3><h1>PortAudioCpp - A Native C++ Binding of PortAudio V19</h1>
<h2>PortAudio</h2>
<p>PortAudio is a portable and mature C API for accessing audio hardware. It offers both callback-based and blocking style input and output, deals with sample data format conversions, dithering and much more. There are a large number of implementations available for various platforms including Windows MME, Windows DirectX, Windows and MacOS (Classic) ASIO, MacOS Classic SoundManager, MacOS X CoreAudio, OSS (Linux), Linux ALSA, JACK (MacOS X and Linux) and SGI Irix AL. Note that, currently not all of these implementations are equally complete or up-to-date (as PortAudio V19 is still in development). Because PortAudio has a C API, it can easily be called from a variety of other programming languages.  </p>
<h2>PortAudioCpp</h2>
<p>Although, it is possible to use PortAudio's C API from within a C++ program, this is usually a little awkward as procedural and object-oriented paradigms need to be mixed. PortAudioCpp aims to resolve this by encapsulating PortAudio's C API to form an equivalent object-oriented C++ API. It provides a more natural integration of PortAudio into C++ programs as well as a more structured interface. PortAudio's concepts were preserved as much as possible and no additional features were added except for some `convenience methods'.  </p>
<p>PortAudioCpp's main features are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Structured object model. </li>
<li>
C++ exception handling instead of C-style error return codes. </li>
<li>
Handling of callbacks using free functions (C and C++), static functions, member functions or instances of classes derived from a given interface. </li>
<li>
STL compliant iterators to host APIs and devices. </li>
<li>
Some additional convenience functions to more easily set up and use PortAudio. </li>
</ul>
<p>PortAudioCpp requires a recent version of the PortAudio V19 source code. This can be obtained from CVS or as a snapshot from the website. The examples also require the ASIO 2 SDK which can be obtained from the Steinberg website. Alternatively, the examples can easily be modified to compile without needing ASIO.  </p>
<p>Supported platforms: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, 7.0 (.NET 2002) and 7.1 (.NET 2003). </li>
<li>
GNU G++ 2.95 and G++ 3.3. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other platforms should be easily supported as PortAudioCpp is platform-independent and (reasonably) C++ standard compliant.  </p>
<p>This documentation mainly provides information specific to PortAudioCpp. For a more complete explaination of all of the concepts used, please consult the PortAudio documentation.  </p>
<p>PortAudioCpp was developed by Merlijn Blaauw with many great suggestions and help from Ross Bencina. Ludwig Schwardt provided GNU/Linux build files and checked G++ compatibility. PortAudioCpp may be used under the same licensing, conditions and warranty as PortAudio. See <a href="http://www.portaudio.com/license.html">the PortAudio license</a> for more details.  </p>
